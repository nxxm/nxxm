## v0.0.9 - codename **far west** 

### Features
  * `nxxm ci` automatically generates a docker enabled Github Action to build C & C++ code
  * Configurable Build engines via `build_engines_mapping.json`
  * Simplified the nxxm installation process thanks to the one liner install scripts now available
  * Support for macOS Big Sur
  * Default NodeJS included is 14.7.0
  * Default CMake included is 3.18.4
  * Possibility to specify `NXXM_HOME_DIR` on the environment, to specify the main nxxm download and build cache location ( _c.f._  [NXXM\_HOME\_DIR Documentation](https://nxxm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-Dependencies_nxxm.html)
  * Build with Visual Studio 16 2019 MSVC via `nxxm . -t vs-16-2019-win64-cxx17`

### Bug fixes
  * Perl is now shipped by nxxm on Windows to accomodate special build processes including OpenSSL
  * Now multiple .cpp files at the top-level folder of an application project ( one with a main() and others without function) work.
  * Fixed build recipe generation for projects in different directories that current nxxm working directory
  * Fix host & cross compiling Boost on Windows
  * Now after 5 downloads retries, nxxm refuses to continue if the SHA1 checksum isn't correct. Precedent version would use the incorrect file.
  * Command line flags `--dont-upgrade, --force-upgrade, --auto-upgrade` can now be passed without any complaints from the options parser, to control nxxm auto-update feature.
  * Improved drastically the test suite to handle build corner cases found at our customers

### Known issues
  - Compiling a project by providing a relative path to it : `nxxm relative/path/to-project` doesn't work. `nxxm .` inside the folder of the project works. 
  - Compiling a project that is stored in a Path where a folder has a space in the name  doesn't work

## ALPHA v0.0.8 
### Features
* Webassembly builds with wasm threads, emscripten 1.39.5 & NodeJS v14.2.0
* Smart parallel build based on available CPU and RAM when `-j` not specified
* HTML5 embedded C++ code is now better debuggable as column and line positions of compile errors are exactly reported 
* CMake upgraded to version 3.17.2
* Platform libraries to the latest version ( e.g. Boost 1.73.0, Poco 1.10.1, Qt 5.11.3... )
* Proper isolation of $HOME/.nxxm files in corresponding nxxm distro ( Now .nxxm/0000001 )
* Better isolation from host system, only additional tools can be found by nxxm, but library, header and module search never escapes the nxxm builds
* Command line parameter parsing relaxed and meaningful errors
* In verbose mode the spinner widget for long-lasting operation is hidden to generate only useful log informations.

### Bug fixes
* Now -DEFINE passed on the command line doesn't prevent further options to be taken in account
* nxxm now closes correctly after timeout SSL connections that don't gracefully close
* disabled macOS ask for Java installation anymore in webassembly build mode
* better information when accessing private repositories

## v0.0.7
* Build by convention by default &amp; Ignores CMakeLists.txt by default unless `-u, --use-cmakelists` or `{ "u" : true }` (or use-cmake.nxxm file is present) is specified on the command line or in `.nxxm/deps`.
* Adds the possibility to only build one of the executable in directory : `-o, --only <executable>` 
* Adds the possibility to select the build type : `-C, --config <MinSizeRel,Release,RelWithDebInfo,Debug>` which enables optimizations or debug symbols accordingly.
* Fix passing apps return code when run with `--test all, appname`
* Fix detection of main function in modern style and more generally with different types and argument count. (See https://github.com/nxxm/nxxm/issues/2) 
* Fix running on plain-vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 (that don't have C++17 libstdc++)
